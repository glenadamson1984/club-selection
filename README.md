# Setups for this project 

This project is setup as follows:-

We wanted the typescript version of create react app so we ran the command - npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

We then created a github repo but going to github in the browser and clicking on create new repository

Then we followed the guide on screen and ran the following in this project in order.

git init
git remote add origin (url of the github repo)
git add .
git commit -m "inital commit"
git push -u origin master

Then we cleaned out the files we didnt need such as the css files and the logo and deleted everything but a div on the App component
